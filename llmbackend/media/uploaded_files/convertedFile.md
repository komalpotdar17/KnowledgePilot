1] Project Title: On Board Count (OBC) Version 1: ( Circuits and Sensor Fusion ). Project Aim: Develop a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) enabled device to accurately count the number of people boarding a particular mode of public transport (e.g., city buses, trains, metros). Points To Consider While Developing the Project: Storage: The MCU should have a minimum of 2KB storage to collect and store data. Device Placement: The device will be mounted on top of the door. Variability in Door Dimensions: The device should accommodate varying door dimensions. Power Source: The device will primarily operate on non-rechargeable batteries but should also support direct Alternating Current (AC) for worst-case scenarios. Image Processing Techniques: Avoid the use of image processing techniques. Environmental Considerations: The device should function properly regardless of environmental conditions. Identification of Infants: The device should differentiate and identify infants to ensure an error-free count. Tamper-Proof Design: The device should be tamper-proof to handle crowded and unsupervised conditions. It should generate alerts in case of tampering, with a threshold set to identify deliberate tampering. Dynamic Installation: The device should be dynamically installable in various public transport services, irrespective of their specific door dimensions or types. 
# Version 2 : ( Computer Vision ).
 Project Aim: Develop a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) enabled device with camera technology to accurately count passengers boarding public transport. 
# Key Requirements:
 Storage Capacity: Minimum 2KB storage for data collection and processing. Device Placement: Positioned atop boarding doors for optimal visibility. Adaptability: Accommodate varying door dimensions for seamless installation. Power Source: Support non-rechargeable batteries and direct AC input. Camera Technology: Capture images/video of boarding passengers for counting. Environmental Robustness: Ensure operation in diverse environmental conditions. Passenger Identification: Differentiate and identify individuals for accurate counting. Tamper-Proof Design: Detect tampering attempts and generate alerts. Dynamic Installation: Easily installable on different types of public transport vehicles.
